# JSON Fixer

# How does it work?

it gets two json files and search for missing properties, when it found it, the jsonFixer fix the missed data.

# Why should I use it if I just can copy the correct json?

The main goal here is different values, for example, We have two json files, the **file 1** is complete but the **file 2** is missing properties but I have values in the **file 2** that I wan't change, if I copy the **file 1** I will need search for my values in **file 2** and change it manually. A good example is translation files like i18 files (en, pt, es), I need to compare the properties but I need to keep the values.
